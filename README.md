# MSA2022-Phase3-Project

This is my project for MSA 2022 Phase 3. I will be doing the same modules as I did in Phase 2, which were the Front-End Module and Data Science Module.

## Front-End Module

I have continued using my Front-End api from Phase 2 to make it easier.

One change I made that is not related to the advanced features is a way to visibily inciate the search mode of the api.

Now for my advanced features that I've implemented:
- UI Scalability with window size
- Mobile first development (using media query breakpoints, etc)
- API connection to your own API that is cloud hosted (Cloud host on Vercel)
- Fluid Animation
- Unit Testing

### UI Scalability and Mobile First Development

The API UI looks different when the screen width is less the 640px, which the buttons would be in a navbar. This allows mobile usability since the buttons would be squashed at lower screen width. Since the requirements of these two advanced features are similar, I decided to use these two features together.

### API connection to your own API that is cloud hosted (Cloud host on Vercel)

My API is now cloud hosted on Vercel. Here is the link: https://msa-2022-phase3-project.vercel.app/

### Fluid Animation

There is two fluid animations I added (if they count). The first is the bouncing title. Second is the dropdown transition (if the screen width is less than 900px), so this is a mobile exclusive feature that they can see this animation (although, can be a bit unconsistent sometimes).

### Unit Testing

## Data Science Module


*Note: this is my second reposititory for this project because there was an issue with the first repository that I was not able to solve and (because of the progress that I've made) I thought it would be easier to create a new repository and copy the old files into this repository than solving this issue. Here is the url for the old repository: https://github.com/MichaelMar7/MSA2022-Phase3-Project.git*
